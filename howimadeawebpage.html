		<br><h1>HOW I MADE A WEBPAGE(like this one)</h1><br>
		
		<div class='flex'>

			<p>hi !!! <br>
			im gonna talk through how i made this website and some of the features of the code i used.<br>so YOU can make a website!</p><br><br>
		</div>
		<h2>HTML</h2>
			<p>
			the languages used to code the webpage are obviously <a href='https://www.w3schools.com/html/'>html</a> and <a href='https://www.w3schools.com/css/'>css</a> cuz i think those are the standard.<br>
			when setting up the basic formula of each webpage i used a container [div] to make a small box in the middle. this is where you are reading rn btw. I used an exact pixel width instead of a percentage
			width so it doesnt squish on mobile [speaking of which its pretty much the width of a phone screen so its compatible!!]<br><br>
			but a plain color in the background is BORING, so i used some background css elements to make an cool galaxy background<br><br>
			<font face='Courier New' color='blue'><b>[EB]: you can also use font face and color elements in html to have segments be different colors.</b></font>
			</p><br>
		<h2>FONT</h2>
			<p>
			with a basic font-family element, you can give the page or certain text elements different fonts! however the only ones from the start are default <font face='Helvetica'>microsoft fonts</font> :[<br><br>
			but you can use downloaded fonts like <a href='https://fontstruct.com/fontstructions/show/1349263/determination-6-1-2'>Determination Mono</a> [this one!] or anything really using an @font-face thingy in the css document.
			yu give it a nickname to refer to when using it and the installer directory and it works! :3
			</p><br>
		<h2>IMAGES [href/src, flex]</h2>
			<p>
			no webpage is complete without a funky image ;] so i use img elements to reference files on my computer [.gif or .jpg] but the <a href='https://blinkies.cafe/'>blinkies</a> on the main page are not 
			in the <a href='#github' class='jump'>repository</a>, so they link to an image link, which can be copied from rightclicking most images online i think. <br><br>
			linking is also important because hyperlinks use href while images use src btw. the repository jump links to the heading that has the id 'github', which is mentioned with '#github' as the link<br><br>
			if i just put an img element followed by a p[paragraph] they would stack. there are other ways to fix this but i use the flex property. i put both the image and text elements into a container with the display:flex;
			property, and they get squished in one line. width and height paramaters and stuff help this look not weird btw
			</p><br>
		<h2 id='github'>HOSTING (github)</h2>
			<p>
			this website would not be here if it was not hosted. there are more better[payed] ways to host but my method uses <a href='https://docs.github.com/en/pages'>github pages</a> so thats what im gonna talk about.<br><br>
			you need an account duh but after that you need to take all the files exactly as they are and put them into a repository. github uses these as a file cloud, which we use for our directories. everything needs to be named
			the same though or the links wont work or the css i think<br><br>
			then you go to the settings for the repository and click the uhh..... the um.... ui give up watch a video or something geek
			</p><br>
		<h2>CONCLUDING</h2>
			<p>
			none of this is really the best way to do it probably so i would not recommend using this as anything meaningful. i also missed stuff like the cursor but it does show i think the intracacies needed to code a website.
			i didnt mention it but if you own a domain like something from <a href='https://domains.cloudflare.com/'>cloudflare</a> you can use that. ALSO HOME PAGE NEEDS TO BE CALLED index.html<br><br>
			goobye ;3
